  abstract = {A new class of distributions, G distributions, arising from the multiplicative
	model is presented in this paper, along with their main properties
	and relations. Their densities are derived for complex and multilook
	intensity and amplitude data. Classical distributions, such as K,
	are particular cases of this new class, A special case of this class
	called here G(0), that has as many parameters as K distributions,
	is shown able to model extremely heterogeneous clutter, such as that
	of urban areas, that cannot be properly modeled with K distributions.
	One of the parameters of this special case is related to the degree
	of homogeneity, and a limiting case is that of a scaled speckle,
	The advantage of the G(0) distribution becomes evident through the
	analysis of a variety of areas (urban, primary forest and deforested)
	from two sensors.},

@BOOK{Lee2009,
  title = {Polarimetric Radar Imaging: From Basics to Applications},
  publisher = {CRC Pres},
  year = {2009},
  author = {Lee, J.-S. and Pottier, E.},
  address = {Boca Raton},
  abstract = {The recent launches of three fully polarimetric synthetic aperture
	radar (PolSAR) satellites have shown that polarimetric radar imaging
	can provide abundant data on the Earthâ€™s environment, such as biomass
	and forest height estimation, snow cover mapping, glacier monitoring,
	and damage assessment. Written by two of the most recognized leaders
	in this field, Polarimetric Radar Imaging: From Basics to Applicationspresents
	polarimetric radar imaging and processing techniques and shows how
	to develop remote sensing applications using PolSAR imaging radar.
	
	
	The book provides a substantial and balanced introduction to the basic
	theory and advanced concepts of polarimetric scattering mechanisms,
	speckle statistics and speckle filtering, polarimetric information
	analysis and extraction techniques, and applications typical to radar
	polarimetric remote sensing. It explains the importance of wave polarization
	theory and the speckle phenomenon in the information retrieval problem
	of microwave imaging and inverse scattering. The authors demonstrate
	how to devise intelligent information extraction algorithms for remote
	sensing applications. They also describe more advanced polarimetric
	analysis techniques for polarimetric target decompositions, polarization
	orientation effects, polarimetric scattering modeling, speckle filtering,
	terrain and forest classification, manmade target analysis, and PolSAR
	interferometry.
	
	
	With sample PolSAR data sets and software available for download,
	this self-contained, hands-on book encourages you to analyze space-borne
	and airborne PolSAR and polarimetric interferometric SAR (Pol-InSAR)
	data and then develop applications using this data.},
